Almost the entirety of Thursday was spent in the cube. We slowly moved teams over to the cube so they could start testing strategy out in our arena. Some teams moved over right at the start of the day, others didn't move over until far later.

As teams moved into the cube, the arena became crowded, as multiple teams tried to use it at once. Borrowing an idea from SR, I decided to run _Tinker Time_, where teams had to book time slots in the arena, so it wasn't quite so crowded.

## _Birthday of the Busse_

One of our team members, Andy, had a birthday over the week, Wednesday. Apparently it's a Smallpeice tradition to sing students _Happy Birthday_ when it's theirs, so we thought we'd steal that tradition with a slight twist.

I can't take the credit for the idea, but I can for the execution. As I was the one running tinker time, I informed students of our plan, quietly, then we called Andy into the room for an unrelated reason, and I took to the stage:

> Is there an Andy Busse in the audience? Andy, a little, Alistair-sized birdie told me it was your birthday yesterday. And so, from everyone here from SourceBots, Smallpeice, and everyone else in the room, we'd like to wish you a happy birthday. Now, I you all know the words, so, 1, 2, 3...

And so, all the students and staff proceeded to sing him _Happy Birthday_. I neglected to consider filming this, but needless to say Andy wasn't exactly thrilled with his oh-so public celebration.

### _Busse's Revenge_

During the lightning talks at the formal dinner later that evening, Andy hatched and executed his cunning plan for revenge. As the original idea was Alistair's, he was the target.

Unknown to Alistair, we moved our development robot over to the formal meal, and intended to get him to do a lightning talk on it. These talks were not only done in front of all those that were in the cube, but also esteemed members of the University.

After Alistair's turn, the rest of the students presented their robots, and gave a speech on how they worked and why they made he design decisions they did. As there was a photographer at the meal, photos [are available](https://www.flickr.com/photos/21203574@N06/sets/72157683751411682/).
