Tuesday is the day we broke it to teams we were taking away their eyes, well, webcams. Apparently this was done in a very comedic way, using pictures and animations, but yet again I was upstairs, again working on the kit. 

Most of the morning was spent finalising the programming tutorial I had to give, and making sure the simulator could be made to work easily on Windows.

## Programming Tutorial

The programming tutorial was split into 2 sections, 1 for teaching the basics of Python, the other for introducing people to kits.

### Basic Python

I've got a lot of experience with Python, having worked with it full time for a number of years, but I'm not necessarily the best to teach it. Instead of spending time attempting to write some lessons, I went to CodeAcademy, selected some of their best Python tutorials, and [noted them down](https://github.com/sourcebots/programming-tutorial/blob/master/basic.md).

### Robot API Tutorial

The idea for the tutorial was to use [PyCharm Edu](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/quickstart/getting_started_educators.html) to create an interactive tutorial guide to our API, so people could play around with it, and get the idea on how to use it, better than any documentation could provide.

Due to time constraints with last minute API changes, I was unable to update the tutorial in time. As an alternative, we shipped the [simulator](https://github.com/sourcebots/simulator), which seemed to go down well. This, along with the documentation seemed to give them enough experience to understand how to use our kit.
