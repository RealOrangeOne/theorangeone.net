Friday was the day we'd all been preparing, the competition! 

Teams started the day again with _Tinker Time_, making the final preparations to their robots. This time I reduced the slots down to 5 minutes (as I meant to do originally), so teams could finalise the strategy.

After _Tinker Time_, we kicked the teams out the cube, so we could run the final tests, clear up the arena, and setup the lighting and music we needed. Once the teams returned, we started on the league matches.

After the league matches, came the knockout matches, and before we knew it, the final!

The final, between team 5 and 6, was a very interesting one, complete with a custom lighting sequence, sound track, and even confetti cannons!

After the final, we played a montage of all the work we've done behind the scenes, that the students didn't see. Originally this montage had no sound affect, which just filled the cube with a fairly awkward silence. Fortunately I know of some pretty good montage music, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzcNzJB-4-E) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAHEiMnbEYI).

The main reason for the montage was to buy us time to print the certificates and get the prizes sorted. Once all that was complete, it was tear-down time!
