[Smallpeice](https://www.smallpeicetrust.org.uk/courses/computing-and-microelectronics/) is a compressed version of the [Student Robotics](/robotics/student-robotics/) competition run by the [Smallpeice Trust](https://www.smallpeicetrust.org.uk/) and [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/). Rather than being run over 6 months like Student Robotics, Smallpeice is run over just 5 days.
