title: Smallpeice
---

[Smallpeice](https://www.smallpeicetrust.org.uk/courses/computing-and-microelectronics/) is competition in a very similar format to that of [Student Robotics]({{< relref "../student-robotics" >}}), but run by the [Smallpeice Trust](https://www.smallpeicetrust.org.uk/) and the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/). Rather than being run over 6 months like Student Robotics, Smallpeice is run over just 5 days.
