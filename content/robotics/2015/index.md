Welcome to the homepage of Collyer's Student Robotics Team 2015 (The 'A' Team) - Creators of 'A.L.I.C.E'! Here you can see everything that goes on throughout the competition.

## The competition
As was announced at kickstart, the game for this year is a take on the classic gamemode Capture the Flag. 4 teams compete over 5 flags to move as many of them as they can into their scoring zones. The person with the most flags in their scoring zone wins.

The 'flags' are 25cm cubes of wood on caster wheels weighing roughly 2kg. The rules prevent us from lifting them, so the idea is to drag them around!
