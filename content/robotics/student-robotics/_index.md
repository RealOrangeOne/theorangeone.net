[Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org) is the the place where my development knowledge really started to grow. Thanks to the other people in my team teaching me. I had never done anything robotics related, and so when my computing teacher initially told us about it, I wasn't really interested. After I found out that my friend was also doing it, I signed up, and went along to the kickstart. From then on I was hooked, getting involved with all aspects of the development and design, as well as helping out other teams on the IRC room.

## My Entries
Being at college for 2 years, meant I was able to enter 2 years of competitions, [SR14]({{< ref "2014" >}}), and [SR15]({{< ref "2015" >}}). We were encouraged to gain an online presence for our team, so I created a basic web page for both years. The original pages have been lost, but the content is all still there.

### Post 2015
Unfortunately, after I left college, I also left behind the ability to enter Student Robotics as a competitor. Fortunately however, [they're always looking for volunteers](https://studentrobotics.org/volunteer/) to help run the competition itself, as a _Blue Shirt_.
