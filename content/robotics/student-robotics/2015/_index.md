## The competition
As was announced at kickstart, the game for this year is a take on the classic game mode Capture the Flag. 4 teams compete over 5 flags to move as many of them as they can into their scoring zones. The person with the most flags in their scoring zone wins.

The 'flags' are 25 centimetres cubes of wood on caster wheels weighing roughly 2 kilograms. The rules prevent us from lifting them, so the idea is to drag them around!
