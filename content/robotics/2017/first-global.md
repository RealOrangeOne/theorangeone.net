After the 2017 Competition, the top 3 teams were given the opportunity to represent the UK at FIRST Global. The teams had to produce videos outlining to FIRST why they should go. My old college, `CLY` won this opportunity.

Whilst I had nothing directly to do with this, I still think it's really impressive!
