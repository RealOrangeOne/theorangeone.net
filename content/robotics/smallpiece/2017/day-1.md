Whilst students arrived on Monday, I wasn't around for this. I was far _far_ too busy putting the finishing touches to the servo controller, and attempting to polish the rest of the kit.

Apparently the students spent most of the day in the workshop, being briefed about the game, and working on initial designs for their robot. The rest of our team were preparing _The Cube_ for the arena, getting the lighting setup, and laying most of the carpet.

## Vision

Unfortunately, it was later that evening we decided to run the competition without vision, as previously advertised. Due to stability issues discovered over the previous 2 days, we concluded we couldn't get it stable enough in time. The decision was not taken lightly, and was one made by the whole team.

Instead of focusing on vision, our attention was then turned back to stabilising the remainder of the kit, as well as updating documentation, and the simulator, which we worked on well into the night.
