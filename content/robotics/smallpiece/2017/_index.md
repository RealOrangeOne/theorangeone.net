Smallpiece 2017 was my first experience into the realm of smallpiece's _Computing and Micro Electronics_ course. This took place between the 29th July and 5th August, for me. The students were only around 31st to 4th.

## The Game 

This year, teams competed in a game called _Tin Can Rally_, a take on a previous [Student Robotics](/robotics) game. Teams had to get around the arena circuit as many times as possible. Each time they passed a quarter marker, they gained a point. If they were carrying one of the 6 tokens in the arena when crossing the line, they would gain an additional point for each. The game was also shorter than standard SR games, at only 2 minutes.
