Given I spend my life attached to some form of computer, I'm not a hard person to get hold of.

If you stumbled across an email address of mine, best not to use it. Like most people my age, I'm not an active user of email. Here are the channels I recommend (in order):

- Twitter: {{< sociallink twitter >}}
- Discord: {{< sociallink discord >}}
- Matrix: {{< sociallink matrix >}}

Want to [say thanks]({{<relref "support" >}})?

Alternatively, you can [Sign my guestbook]({{<relref "guestbook">}}).
