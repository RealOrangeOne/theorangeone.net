# Hacktoberfest 2019

This is year number 3 of my participation in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), the initiative from DigitalOcean, and new this year, [Dev.to](https://dev.to/). In previous years, the objective was to submit 5 pull requests to an open-source project. This year, the number was reduced to 4, for some reason.

In [2018]({{< relref "hacktoberfest-2018" >}}), I submitted a total of 10 pull requests to open-source projects. This year, I did a few more than that.

## My contributions

Whilst DigitalOcean did have an official checker this year, it was garbage! Not only was it incredibly slow, but it was only possible to see _your_ pull requests, rather than any user. Instead, the third-party [Hacktoberfest Checker](https://hacktoberfestchecker.jenko.me/user/RealOrangeOne) shows the relevant pull requests.

## Overview

As with last year, I personally consider many of these contributions invalid, primarily because they don't really fit with the spirit of Hacktoberfest. Namely, all those under the `srobo` organisation don't especially fit, and the ones on my own repos. Excluding those, there's still more than enough to get my t-shirt!
