Recently, at DabApps, we've been migrating our mobile app workflow over to using [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) rather than [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), mainly because of its near native performance. For the first few projects, there were only a couple of us that knew how to use React Native effectively, and work around the _qwerks_ it has. With the number of app projects growing, we needed to get more people up to speed with the react native workflow, as quickly as possible.

The workflow that we needed to adopt to use react native is an odd one. To keep the quality of our code at the highest possible, whilst keeping the codebase as maintainable as possible. The workflow we use was created by 4 of us, through experiences with both work and personal projects using the framework, and it works rather well. The only problem was that only 4 of us actually knew it.

After a colleague wanted to know more about react-native, and with a couple of potential app projects on the horizon, I created a talk for our (_usually_) bi-weekly dev meetings, with the aim of trying to get everyone up to speed, all in 1 go.

The slides from my talk are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/react-native-intro-dev-meeting) page, and whilst they are primarily relevant to our workflow, I hope they will be able to help anyone else looking to get started with React Native.

React Native is a tricky platform to get started on, but once you understand the _qwerks_, I believe it truly is the future of cross-platform mobile development!
