subtitle: Hacking is fun!

Personally, I dislike being limited by technology. If there's a system in place like a proxy filter, network restrictions, or even any remote control software, I just have to try and break through it or work around it.

Throughout my time there, I was able to break through many parts of their network, mostly the sections involving keeping us students on task. The hardest part of this was doing it in such a way that it couldn't be traced back to me, just in case they didn't appreciate me _testing_ their systems. Whilst I don't condone doing this, it is certainly a lot of fun, and I learnt a whole lot through it. To this day, they still have no idea I did any of it, unless they're reading this, in which case, __Hi__!

The tool of choice of my college to monitor students usage of computers. Turns out it's not particularly robust!
