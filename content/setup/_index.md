My setup is much more a project than something that is stable and constant. I am constantly upgrading, and changing things, whether it's on my main machine (which most of it is), my desk at work, or my laptop. As I use technology every day, for many, __many__ hours, I need it to work brilliantly, and not hold me back from anything I want to do.

As well as my main desk, there are a few other machines I use often, namely my laptop, work rig, and my phone. All of which follow the same criteria of not holding me back from whatever I to do.
