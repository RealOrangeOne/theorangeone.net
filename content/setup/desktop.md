My setup is everything, I use my computer at least once a day to browse the internet, work on projects, even update this website, so it's very important that everything works perfectly and the fastest it can. Obviously this machine is probably a little too powerful for someone that does almost primarily web development, but it means when I want to do things like video editing, 3D modelling, or anything else that would require a high end computer, I can, because my computer is equipped to handle it.

Over the years, my setup has evolved from a single monitor i5 machine, to a triple monitor AMD FX-based monster of a computer.

### Next Generation

I've been using the current generation for around 5 years now, and it's worked perfectly for all of this. The main reason I'm upgrading is to get more features, The 990FX chipset is very old, and my motherboard is missing a few key features, such as dynamic fan control.

The next generation of my build isn't actually a thing yet, but I'm actively working on what it's going to look like and the components inside it. You can find the current parts list at the link below, the list is always changing.

#### OS
I use Arch Linux on all my machines now, But some days I miss my windows-only applications and games, so I plan to use a virtual machine running windows, with a graphics card hardware pass-through to it to run windows applications, and play windows-only games. I got the idea for doing this from this amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16dbAUrtMX4).

## Previous Generations

The first generation was the first custom build I'd ever done. When I first built it, I wasn't really into gaming, or any kind of heavy workflow for that matter, so it wasn't particularly powerful, although compared to my old [Dell Inspiron 1525](http://www.pcworld.com/product/31104/dell-inspiron-1525.html), it was pretty damn incredible!

You can find the full list of parts over on the PCPartPicker link below. Unfortunately due to the lack of catalog, or bad memory on my part, not all the parts are there, but there are as many as possible.
