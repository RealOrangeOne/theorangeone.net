title: Public web server
---

My public server one of the VMs on my dedicated server. This VM actually runs [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/), allowing me to easily deploy applications no matter what they're written in! There are currently several containers running on this server, some public websites, some applications just for me to use.

The best feature of [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) is the easy integration with [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), so I can easily add https connection to applications, even if they don't natively support it!
