title: State of the Apps
---

Every year right towards the end (or beginning, depending on how you look at it), I look back over the tools I've used over the last year, and what might change about them in the upcoming year.

I'm ~~stealing~~ borrowing inspiration from [CGP Grey](https://www.cgpgrey.com/) / [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/) and their ["State of the Apps"](https://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/state-of-the-apps-2014/) episodes.
