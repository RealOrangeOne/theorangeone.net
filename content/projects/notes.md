As someone who spends a lot of time at a computer, you pick up certain commands and tricks which make life easier. Unfortunately, the human brain can only remember so much. And shell reverse search can't remember everything.

To store things like this, I created a "notes" site, powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [`gatsby-theme-code-notes`](https://github.com/mrmartineau/gatsby-theme-code-notes/). I don't really like my static sites to have a massive react frontend, but this theme just looks so nicely that it's worth the [initial pain](https://github.com/mrmartineau/gatsby-theme-code-notes/issues/65).

There's not a huge amount there yet, but it's growing.
