title: Development Playlist

When I work, and need to focus and get something done, I like a specific kind of music. It helps me focus and work much faster than listening to other music, or nothing at all. The work isn't necessary software development, but seeing as that's what I do most of the time, it's usually what happens.

I've created this playlist over the last few years, removing and adding song when I find new ones.
