This year, we tried something different. Rather than having the [dramatic playlist]({{< relref "dramatic-soundtrack" >}}), we created a chill playlist for outside of match time. This not only helped make the breaks feel more like breaks, and a bit more fun, but also acted as a contrast to make the match time feel more dramatic.
